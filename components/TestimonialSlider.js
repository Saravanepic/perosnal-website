                      He is a beast in coding. I am working with Saravana for the last couple of months and he is the best guy I have found in my development team. He is very instant in responding, doing the work on time, I think he never sleeps. I have already worked with Saravana on 15+ projects and we have to go a long way. He is very knowledgeable. He pays close attention to details. He is also very patient in client training and taking calls. Thanks a lot, Saravana.
